	<p>Derek Carr is a promising, third-year quarterback. He's also the best Raiders quarterback since the days of Rich Gannon.
So, the Raiders had every right to panic when they watched Carr try to jump over a Saints defensive back in their season-opener Sunday. Carr not only survived, but he also picked up a first down.
Quarterbacks are athletes, too.

The Raiders coaching staff should probably tell Carr to never do that again. If Carr were to go down, then Matt McGloin would take over quarterback duties. In other words, the Raiders' 2016 season -- their best chance to make the playoffs in forever -- would be over.
At halftime, the Raiders trail the Saints by a touchdown, 17-10. Follow along with our gametracker here.</p>

	<p>The dynamic between former Los Angeles Lakers teammates Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant has always been one of the most interesting storylines in the history of the NBA. The two seemed to have both a mutual animosity and respect for each other during their playing days and that hot/cold relationship continued after O'Neal retired from the game.
But the two were always very successful on the court, winning three championships together and teaming up to be one of the most dominant teams in the late '90s and early 2000s. Also their relationship nowadays seems like it's never been better. But despite that, O'Neal revealed before his Hall of Fame induction that Bryant had not reached out to congratulate him on his impending enshrinement.
A rather odd move for Bryant to make but it was one he rectified on Friday:</p>
