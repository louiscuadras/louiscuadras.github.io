	<p>FORMER 8-division world champion and future hall-of-famer Manny Pacquiao (58-6-2, 38 KOs) kicked off training camp in the Philippines this week. The former welterweight champion, currently serving as a senator in his native country, seeks to recapture the same WBO World title he lost to Floyd Mayweather in May of 2015.

Across the ring from Pacquiao on November 5 will be the current WBO champion at 147 pounds, Jessie Vargas (27-1, 10 KOs). Vargas acquired the belt in March of this year in a vacant title opportunity opposite then-unbeaten Sadam Ali in Washington DC.</p>

	  <p>When Conor McGregor walked with a majority decision win after 25 minutes of hard-fought action against Nate Diaz at UFC 202 on Saturday, the general consensus amongst fans and pundits was both men would have to meet for a third time to officially settle the score.
After all, Diaz, winner of season five of The Ultimate Fighter, defeated McGregor in their initial bout at UFC 196 in March. The Stockton native had taken the fight on just 10 days notice after McGregorâ€™s original opponent, former lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos, pulled out with a broken foot. As a result, both McGregor and Diaz agreed to fight at welterweight.</p>
